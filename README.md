I've been playing around with various datasets (some from [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com), some not) and frameworks (Tensorflow, Keras, PyTorch, Flax) to experiment with deep learning. I'm trying my best to keep things as organized as possible, but I apologize if things are less polished than they should be since this repo is purely for educational purposes.
